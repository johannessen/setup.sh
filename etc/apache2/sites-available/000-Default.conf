# This config file is supposed to catch requests not caught by any other
# virtual host configuration, including requests with an HTTP/1.1 Host header
# containing this server's IP address.

# Configuration is identical for both HTTP and HTTPS access. We do not want
# redirects, as this is the fallback setup. The common configuration exists
# in the '000-Default.include' file. Make sure to always keep the server's
# IP address current in there.


# This is the default virtual host.
<VirtualHost *:80 _default_:80>
	Include sites-available/000-Default.include
</VirtualHost>


# TLS for the default site
# (not particularly useful, as we can't use SNI for this one 
# and thus have to fall back to a self-signed certificate)
<VirtualHost *:443 _default_:443>
	Include sites-available/000-Default.include

	SSLCertificateFile     /etc/ssl/certs/ssl-cert-snakeoil.pem
	SSLCertificateKeyFile  /etc/ssl/private/ssl-cert-snakeoil.key
</VirtualHost>


# Note that the _default_ address in the VirtualHost directive does not have
# any effect in this configuration (solely name-based virtual hosting).
# (This note may by outdated.)
